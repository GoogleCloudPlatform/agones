## Usage

The Unreal Engine plugin is specifically designed to be as simple as possible. No programming should be required to use the plugin within your Unreal Engine project.

### From source

At this moment we do not provide binaries for the plugin. This requires you to compile the plugin yourself. In order to do this you need to have a C++ Unreal Engine project. 

1. Create a `Plugins` directory in your Unreal Engine project root directory.
2. Copy {{< ghlink href="sdks/unreal" >}}the Agones plugin directory{{< /ghlink >}} into the Plugins directory.
3. Build the project.

## Settings

The settings for the Agones Plugin can be found in the Unreal Engine editor `Edit > Project Settings > Plugins >  Agones`
